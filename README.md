# Film Advisor

## Description 

For this collaborative project, our task was to create an application that solves a real-world problem. Our group chose to create a movie reviews website where the user can search any movie and see the reviews for that movie. We were inspired by IMBD and wanted to put the main focus on the user review aspect than any other information. To accomplish this task, we used the skills we have learned over the past 6 weeks and incorporated html, css, javascript and API's.

Our group started out by creating a repository on github and we each divided tasks to work on and created our own feature branches within the develop branch. We built out the html with a background image that correlated with the project concept, included a logo to represent our title and a search bar for the user to interact with. We chose Tailwind for our css framework which assisted with styling/structuring and bringing the page to life. Next for our API's we used IMBD which allowed us to fetch reviews for any film. 

Overall this project was a great window into the world of collaboration among developers. One of our biggest challenges was getting used to working with git as a group and making sure everyones files were aligned and up to date. In the end, it was rewarding to see each of our skills come together to create <a href ="https://paulkalait.github.io/film-adivser/"> Film Advisor.</a>
